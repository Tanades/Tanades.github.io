Blue, while possibly the most simple machine on Hack The Box, demonstrates the severity of the EternalBlue exploit, which has been used in multiple large-scale ransomware and crypto-mining attacks since it was leaked publicly.

## Walkthrough

### Reconnaissance

We will start by **scanning protocolos** in the target machine, this can be divided in 3 phases:
1. Scan for **open ports**
2. Scan for **services** in these open ports
3. Scan for **vulnerabilities** in these services

<br />
Let's start by scanning for **open ports**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sU 10.10.10.40 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oG all_ports.txt --open -n -Pn
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

There are 9 open ports, however the last 5 ports are related to the VPN connection, so we may say that there are **3 open ports**:
- **135/tcp**
- **139/tcp**
- **445/tcp**

<br />
Let's check which **services** are running in these ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.40 -p 135,139,445 -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oX open_ports.xml -oN open_ports.txt --version-all -n -Pn -A -v
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

We can see that the two services correspond to:
- **135/tcp Microsoft Windows RPC**
- **139/tcp Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn**
- **445/tcp Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1 microsoft-ds (workgroup: WORKGROUP)**

<br />
This scan gives critical pieces of information, as we can see we are facing a **Windows 7** machine, which is a really old and vulnerable version of Windows, now we will seek for **vulnerabilities**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.40 -p 135,139,445 -T4 --min-rate 5000 --script="vuln and safe or intrusive and safe or discovery" -oN vulns.txt -oX vulns.xml -n -Pn -v
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

The vulnerability scan returned a severe vulnerability, **ms17-010** is a security patch for Windows that mitigates vulnerabilities related to message delivery to **SMB** servers. Vulnerabilities like **EternalBlue** is an exploit designed to leverage these vulnerabilities.

### Foothold

<br />
Since this is a really old exploit, it's hard to load all of it's dependencies, so we will use **Metasploit**:

```bash
sudo msfdb run
```

Let's search for an exploit for this vulnerability: 

![exploits](/assets/Blue/Pasted image 20240801003203.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

I will select **exploit 1** and **configure the options**:

<br />
<br />
<br />

Let's finally run it, the exploit may fail, just execute it until it works, after a few times, I got a **meterpreter session**, which I converted into a **shell**:

<br />
<br />
<br />

It seems that we are already **nt authority\\system**, so we have got **user.txt** and **root.txt** at the same time.
